# htmx-todo

This is a proof of concept for a tech stack utilizing htmx, Hono, and Cloudflare Workers.

## Usage

First, we have to make a copy `/wrangler.toml.example` and rename it to `wrangler.toml`. This is where your environment variables are stored and consumed by Cloudflare's Wrangler CLI.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luzefiru/htmx-todo.git
cd htmx-todo
npm i
npm run dev
```
